                             MNC - Multicast NetCat
                            -----------------------

1. Introduction

mnc is a simple, one-direction-at-a-time, "netcat"-like application using
multicast. The aim is to provide a tool for easy debugging and testing when
setting up a multicast network or host. MNC supports IPv4 and IPv6
any-source-multicast and single-source-multicast.

man doc/mnc.1 for information and help on how to run multicast.

2. Supported platforms

As of September 2004, mnc has been compiled and tested with Linux 2.6.8 kernels
and the BSD KAME stack. Currently automatic interface selection does not work
on a KAME-based host and you will need to specify the interface when in
listening mode.

3. Installing mnc from source

	./configure ; make ; make install

4. Reporting problems

Any problems, bugs or suggested features should be mailed to colm.maccarthaigh
