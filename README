                             MNC - Multicast NetCat
                            ------------------------

1. Introduction

mnc is a simple, one-direction-at-a-time, "netcat"-like application using
multicast. The aim is to provide a tool for easy debugging and testing when
setting up a multicast network or host. MNC supports IPv4 and IPv6
any-source-multicast and single-source-multicast, but depending on your
platform some of those features may not be available:
       
       L = Listen (Implies IGMP/MLD mupport)
       S = Send

man doc/mnc.1 for information and help on how to run multicast.

2. Supported platforms

As of September 2004, mnc has been compiled and tested with Linux 2.6.8
kernels, the BSD KAME stack and Windows XP Profesional. Currently automatic
interface selection does not work on a KAME-based host and you will need to
specify the interface when in listening mode.

3. Installing mnc from source on UNIX:

	./configure ; make ; make install

4. Compiling from source on Windows:

nmc is compilable with free utilities available from Microsoft. You need to
download and install the free (as in beer) MS Visual C++ command-line tools
from:
	
	http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/vctoolkit2003/

and the SDK relevant to your platform from:

	http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/

You can run a Visual C++ command-line session, and use:

	cl /DWINDOWS=1 /TC /c *.c 
	link /fixed /out:mnc.exe *.obj ws2_32.lib

to compile a working mnc.exe. The Windows version of MNC does not yet fully
support IPv6 due to underlying limitation in the Operating System.

5. Reporting problems

Any problems, bugs or suggested features should be mailed to colm
at apache.org.

6. Usage 


NG-MVPN testing with SRX
Sunday, December 1, 2013
I've been doing some testing with NextGen Multicast VRF support on some SRX220's. I've been using the MNC utility https://code.google.com/p/mnc/ to do my testing and found it to be a good tool for the job and have it running on a pari of raspberry PI's that are powered from the front of the SRX220's.

So, grab the code, uncompress and build as follows;

./autoconf

./configure

make

sudo make install

Once you have the mnc binary compiled you simply run one instance as a multicast sender and one as a receiver. I've concocted the following simple bash loop to send the time in seconds since epoch to a multicast group which allows me to take simple measurements when failing over LSP's etc.

Server side

while true; do printf "IPv4 Multicast --> " ; date +%s ;sleep 1;done| mnc -p 1234 236.1.1.2

Client side

/mnc -l -p 1234 236.1.1.2

If all is working on the client side you will see this constantlyâ€¦in one second increments.

pi@MC-Server ~ $ ./mnc -l -p 1234 236.1.1.2

IPv4 Multicast --> 1385898549
IPv4 Multicast --> 1385898550
IPv4 Multicast --> 1385898551
IPv4 Multicast --> 1385898552
IPv4 Multicast --> 1385898553
IPv4 Multicast --> 1385898554

The only other trickery I've had to modify was the IGMP version on my Linux box which defaulted to 0, 
effectively using the highest version available to it. I hardcoded this to 2 which resolved any IGMP 
issues I was having. (sudo echo 2 >  /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/force_igmp_version)
