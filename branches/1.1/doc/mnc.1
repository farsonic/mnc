.SH NAME
mnc \- Multicast NetCat
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR mnc 
[ -l ] [ -i interface ] [ -p port ] group-id [ source-address ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mnc
is designed for simple multicast debugging and testing. It supports
IPv4 and IPv6 any-source multicast and source-specific multicast.
In standard mode it will multicast the standard-input verbatim. 
In listening mode it recieves the content and displays it on the 
standard output.
.PP
When given the optional source-address, mnc will attempt to use
source-specific multicast. You may also specify this address
in standard mode and mnc will use this source-address for
outgoing packets.

.IP \-i\ "interface"
